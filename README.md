# CN4001 - Weekly Lab Tasks

This is a list of weekly lab tasks given at UEL for the module mentioned above.

## Week 02

Creating an app that will dispaly the name and the zodiac sign of the user.

1. Create the java file `ZodiacApp.java`.
```bash
touch ZodiacApp.java
```
2. Print your name and your zodiac sign as shown below.

This is the boiler plate code for java to run.
```java
public class ZodiacApp
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Your code goes here.
    }
}
```
And the output will be like what follows.
```bash
Don Lee
Leo
```

## Week 03

Use mathematical operations in java to calculate the diameter and area of the circle.

1. Create the java file `CircleApp.java` and add the boilerplate code in the file.
```bash
touch CircleApp.java
```
- Boilerplate code.
```java
public class CircleApp
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        
    }
}
```
2. Declare all the variables (remember `pi` is a **constant**) and name the input scanner object `sc`.
3. Write code to print the title (*\** CIRCLE APP *\**) and the final "END OF PROGRAM" message on the screen.
Title
```
*** CIRCLE APP ***
```
End
```
END OF PROGRAM
```
4. Ask the user to input the value for radius.
5. Calculate the diameter of the circle with the values and print on screen.
6. Calculate the area of the circle and print on screen.
7. Add some javadoc comments at the top of program.
